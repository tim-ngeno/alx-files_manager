## Introduction

This project aims to provide a robust file management system with features for uploading, viewing, and managing files securely. Leveraging the power of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Redis, and Bull, it offers a scalable and efficient solution for file storage and management.

## Features

- User authentication via JWT tokens
- File listing and browsing
- Uploading and downloading files
- Thumbnail generation for images
- Permission management for files
- Background processing for file operations

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing file metadata and user information.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and temporary storage.
- **Bull**: Queue management library for background processing of file operations.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables:
   - `DB_HOST`: MongoDB host (default: localhost)
   - `DB_PORT`: MongoDB port (default: 27017)
   - `DB_DATABASE`: MongoDB database name (default: files_manager)
   - `REDIS_HOST`: Redis host (default: localhost)
   - `REDIS_PORT`: Redis port (default: 6379)
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. Access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:<port>`


## File Management

### Creating an API with Express

Express.js is used to create the RESTful API for managing files. Endpoints are defined to handle various file operations such as uploading, downloading, viewing, and deleting files.

Here's a basic example of creating a simple API with Express:

```javascript

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON bodies

// Routes
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'List of users' });
});

app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const { username, email } = req.body;
  // Handle user creation logic
  res.json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### User Authentication
To authenticate a user in a Node.js application, you can use various methods such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), sessions, or OAuth. Here's a general approach using JWT:

- User Login: When a user logs in with their credentials, generate a JWT token containing their user ID or other relevant information.

- Token Verification: For protected routes, verify the JWT token sent by the client on each request. If the token is valid, allow access to the route; otherwise, return an authentication error.

- Token Renewal: Optionally, implement token renewal or refresh token mechanism to extend the validity of the JWT token without requiring the user to log in again.

User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and used for subsequent requests to protected endpoints. This ensures secure access to file management functionalities.

### Storing Data in MongoDB

MongoDB is used to store file metadata and user information. The database provides a scalable solution for storing structured data and enables efficient querying and retrieval of file-related information.

### Storing Temporary Data in Redis

Redis is utilized for caching and temporary data storage. It helps improve performance by caching frequently accessed data and reducing the load on the MongoDB database. Temporary data such as session tokens and file upload progress can be stored in Redis for quick retrieval.

### Background Worker Setup

To set up and use a background worker for tasks such as processing files asynchronously, you can use libraries like Bull or Agenda. Here's an overview:

- Install Library: Install the background worker library (bull, agenda, etc.) using npm.

- Define Jobs: Define background jobs that need to be processed asynchronously. This could include tasks like file processing, sending emails, etc.

- Queue Creation: Create a job queue to manage and process the background jobs.

- Job Processing: Define job processors to handle the execution of background jobs. These processors typically listen to the job queue and execute jobs as they become available.

- Queue Management: Start the job queue and add jobs to the queue as needed from your application code.

Bull is used for background processing of file operations such as thumbnail generation. Background workers handle these tasks asynchronously, ensuring efficient resource utilization and improved responsiveness of the application.

Here's a basic example using Bull for background job processing:

```javascript

const Queue = require('bull');

// Create a new job queue
const fileProcessingQueue = new Queue('fileProcessing');

// Define job processor
fileProcessingQueue.process(async (job) => {
  // Process the file associated with the job
  console.log(`Processing file: ${job.data.fileName}`);
});

// Add job to the queue
fileProcessingQueue.add({ fileName: 'example.txt' });
```
